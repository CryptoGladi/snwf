# Motivation

If you just need to transfer a file over the network to another computer,
but you don't want to write hundreds of lines of code to implement a
"receiver" and "sender", then this library is right for you.

# Features

'udt' - enable [udt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP-based_Data_Transfer_Protocol) protocol support

# Example

### Send file

```rust
async main() {

}
```

### Get file

```rust
async main() {

}
```
